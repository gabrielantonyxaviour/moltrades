# Generate Pitch Deck: Moltrades 領域展開

Use the `pitch-deck-generator` skill to create a hackathon pitch deck for Moltrades.

## Project Info

**App Name:** Moltrades (領域展開)
**Tagline:** Describe what you want. Watch your domain expand across chains in real-time.
**Hackathon:** HackMoney 2026
**Accent Color:** #C62828 (Deep Crimson Red)

## Problem Narrative

"You have ETH on Arbitrum, USDC on Base, and you want yield on Polygon. What do you do? Open 4 tabs. Research which DEX has the best rates. Figure out which bridge is cheapest. Execute swap, bridge, deposit, stake - that's 4+ transactions, 4 different UIs, 20 minutes of your life. And you still don't know if you got the best route. Even experienced DeFi users waste hours on routine operations."

**Problem Bullets:**
- Assets fragmented across chains - ETH here, USDC there, yield somewhere else
- Complex multi-step workflows require 4+ transactions
- Need technical knowledge - which DEX? which bridge? which protocol?
- No visibility - submit tx and pray, no idea what's happening

**Problem GIF:** Search for "confused math lady" or "too many tabs" or "overwhelmed"

## Solution

**Transformation:** "From DeFi archaeology to domain expansion"

**Solution Bullets:**
- Describe what you want in plain English: "Put half into best stablecoin yield"
- AI generates a visual flowchart of all steps before execution
- Cross-chain execution via LI.FI Composer - one click, multiple chains
- Watch each node complete in real-time with live animations

**Solution GIF:** Search for "domain expansion" or "satisfying flowchart" or "everything connected"

## How It Works

Flow steps:
1. Describe Intent
2. AI Plans Route
3. Approve Domain
4. Watch Expansion

## Sponsors & Ecosystem Fit

**Sponsors:** LI.FI, Uniswap v4, Sui

**Why This Matters:**
- LI.FI Composer API gets a showcase for multi-step AI-powered workflows
- Uniswap v4 as the swap layer for agentic finance
- Ships as MCP server - every Claude Code user gets DeFi superpowers

## Instructions

1. Use `gifgrep` to find appropriate problem/solution GIFs (JJK domain expansion memes would be perfect)
2. Use `/gemini-image` to generate a logo: "Minimalist app logo: geometric expanding domain pattern with concentric shapes radiating outward like an expansion or awakening. Deep indigo (#1a1a2e) and crimson red (#C62828). Japanese-influenced minimalist design. No text. Square format."
3. Generate the pitch deck following the 8-slide structure
4. Save to: `/Users/gabrielantonyxaviour/Documents/workspaces/ethglobal/ideas/decks/moltrades_pitch.pptx`
